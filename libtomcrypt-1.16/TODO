stopped at ch12
-- needs examples for ecc/dsa!!! (and for asn.1)

must have for v1.16
- document PK build flags
- document makefile flags [INSTALL_* for instance]
- prepare manual for printing (both soft and hard cover)

Nice to have [in order of precedence]
- add X9.63 IES
- add CPP macros like OpenSSL has for ASN1 (e.g. encode/decode functions, etc) shameless ripoff :-)
