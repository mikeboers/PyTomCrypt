- Have classes build for each of the modes. This way we don't need to dispatch
  at every call.
    - First time the difference to see if it even matters.
    - Decide upon the API for this:
        - Could pass the cipher to the mode class: cipher = CipherCBC('aes')
        - Could have a class for each combination: cipher = AES_CBC('key')
        - Could have a function which picks from one of the above for you:
            cipher = build(mode='cbc', cipher='aes')
        - Could have __new__ on Cipher* pick the right class depending on the
          mode and cipher.
- OR, IFF we don't have to explicitly cast the symmetric_*, then figure out
  how to save pointers to functions and pick those in the setup.
  I have now tried this, and it actually went slightly slower. Ie. 161ms
  instead of 159ms.
